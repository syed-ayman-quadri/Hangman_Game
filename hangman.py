Summary: This is a simple hangman game.

Detail: This game picks a random word and displays the first and last letters.
        Then the user guesses the remaining letters.
        The user gets 7 tries to guess the correct letters. For every wrong guess, the user loses tries.
        If the user guesses a correct letter and the letter appears more than once, then all the occurrences
        of the letter get filled.
        If the user successfully guesses all the letters before their tries run out, they win.
        Otherwise the correct letter is displayed and they lose.
